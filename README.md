# Building Economic Dynamism
## Can the West Grow Again?

An ebook version of the PDF published at https://www.arc-research.org/s/David-Frost-Building-Economic-Dynamism.pdf

> Almost every Western economy is facing slowing economic growth or, for some, stagnation.

All I have done is copy/paste the original work into an ebook format, as I find these much easier to read on my Kindle. And as it is an excellent essay, I thought others might be interested.
